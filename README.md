# PE Chatbot

The **PE Chatbot** is an interactive chatbot that uses AI to provide automated responses to users. It is designed to assist with various tasks by processing user inputs and generating context-aware replies. This chatbot leverages OpenAI's language models for natural language processing and understanding.

## Description

This project implements a chatbot that:

- Listens to user input in the form of text.
- Processes the input to understand user intent.
- Responds with appropriate, context-aware answers based on the input received.
- Utilizes the OpenAI GPT-3/4 API for generating human-like responses.

The chatbot can be expanded to handle more complex scenarios and can be integrated into various platforms, such as web applications, messaging services, or customer service tools.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** The chatbot understands user input and responds based on the context.
- **Interactive Conversations:** Users can hold conversations, ask questions, and receive answers dynamically.
- **Powered by GPT-3/4:** The chatbot generates realistic and coherent responses using the latest AI models.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The primary programming language used for development.
- **OpenAI GPT-3/4 API:** For text generation and processing user input.
- **Flask (Optional):** Used for running the chatbot in a web environment (if applicable).
- **NLTK/Spacy (Optional):** For additional NLP capabilities.

## How the Code Works

1. **User Input:** The user sends a message to the chatbot.
2. **Processing:** The input is passed through a pre-defined pipeline that processes the text. This might include basic cleaning, tokenization, or other NLP tasks.
3. **AI Response:** The cleaned and processed input is sent to the OpenAI API, where it uses GPT-3/4 to generate a relevant response.
4. **Output:** The chatbot then sends the generated response back to the user, allowing for a continuous conversation.

## Setup and Installation

To run the chatbot on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HenryMorganDibie/PE-chatbot.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd PE-chatbot
    ```

3. **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   - On macOS/Linux:

     ```bash
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

5. **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. **Create a `.env` file** and add your OpenAI API key:

    ```bash
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    ```

7. **Run the chatbot:**

    If you're running the chatbot as a command-line tool, use:

    ```bash
    python chatbot.py
    ```

    For a Flask-based web interface:

    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

## Example Usage

1. **Start the chatbot:**
   - If running the command-line version, just type your message after starting the chatbot.

2. **Example interaction:**

    ```
    User: What's the weather like today?
    Chatbot: The weather is sunny with a chance of rain later in the evening.
    ```
